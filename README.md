# NumPy
- __NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational package for mathematical computing in Python.__
- It supports fast and efficient multidimensional arrays (ndarray).
- Executes element-wise computations and mathematical calculations.
- Performs linear algebraic operations, Fourier transforms and random number generation.
- It has tools for reading/writing array based datasets to disk.
- It has efficient way of storing and manipulating data.
- Numpy is a Python library, that supports a data container called Arrays. Arrays are like Lists but they can do something that Lists can't. They easily allow you to perform mathematical operations over the entire dataset.
